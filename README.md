# shell_scripting
Contents related to my study and practice of shell scripting.
I started an introductory course on DevOps, where i learned about the basics of servers with Bash on Linux Ubuntu. This included navigating directories and creating, editing, removing, and copying files.
The course also covered shell scripts using nano text editor and bash as the code interpreter.
As part of the exercises, i wrote scripts for simple actions as compressing and extracting files, monitoring memory and cpu usage and automating tasks with crontab.
The files are located in this directory. Please feel free to contact me with any corrections or suggestions.

Thank you, see you!!
